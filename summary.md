# Title


## Summary
<!-- 250 chars -->
XXX connects an urban population to the models that drive urban
planning.  The result is better models and increased transparency in the
planning process.

## Details

Urban and Transportation planners have the unenviable task of modeling
the population's behavior and using that to evaluate suggested policy.
This is a balance between science and art, engineering and politics.
More often than not, the core need to produce *something* leads to
necessarily simplified models that are only occasionally sensitive to
the things that matter and are rarely critically evaluated in
retrospect.

XXX extends the concept of open data to *open model* by allowing
*everyone* to:

* the see the predictions made by urban professionals and used by
  decision makers,
  
* use the outputs of these models for their own purposes,

* evaluate the quality of these models on an ongoing basis,

* inject data directly into these models to improve their quality.


## Key products

* Adding urban *recent* forecasting data to the open data catalogue

* Opening current forecasting models for the public's use


## Challenges

* Models differ across regions, cities, and even localities.  Finding a
  common language for representing these model systems is central to
  XXX.  The common state of the practice offers guidance...

* How to bring data into the system

* How to protect privacy


## Long term benefits

XXX is about connecting the public with urban transportation policy
making.  Our vision is that true transparency is impossible without
opening the models that drive that policy.  Furthermore, we know that
